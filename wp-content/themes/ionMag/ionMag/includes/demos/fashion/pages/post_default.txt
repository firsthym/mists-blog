It's how you carry yourself, how you speak, what you read. We have got to change our ethics and our financial system and our whole way of understanding the world.

It has to be a world in which people live rather than die a sustainable world.I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things. It's the attitude you bring to clothes that make the difference. Everything I do is a matter of heart, body and soul.

I think it's an old fashioned notion that fashion needs to be exclusive to be fashionable. I am no longer concerned with sensation and innovation, but with the perfection of my style.

You're only as good as your last collection, which is an enormous pressure. Elegance is not the prerogative of those who have just escaped from adolescence, but of those who have already taken possession of their future.

Attitude is everything. You have a more interesting life if you wear impressive clothes. I wanted to dress the woman who lives and works, not the woman in a painting. My dresses are very reasonably priced, for dresses that are cut on the body.

<div class="td-paragraph-padding-1">

You can never take too much care over the choice of your glasses. Too many women think that they are unimportant, but the real proof of an elegant woman is what is on her feet.
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span class="td_text_highlight_marker_yellow td_text_highlight_marker" style="margin: 0;">I always thought what you wore underneath was as important as what you wear on top.

War taught me that not everything is glamorous. I didn't want to be a fashion designer, and for a good half of my career I didn't like it. I always wanted to do other things.

<div class="td-paragraph-padding-2">

<em><span class="td_text_highlight_marker_yellow td_text_highlight_marker">We must never confuse elegance with snobbery.</span></em> Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity. Design and style should work toward making you look good and feel good without a lot of effort so you can get on with the things that matter.

I'm an accomplice to helping women get what they want. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of.
